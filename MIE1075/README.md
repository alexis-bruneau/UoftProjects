# Autonomous Robotic Dishwasher Arm

In our project, we propose a method to have an autonomous robotic arm for dishes. 
Our process follows these main steps: object localization, object pose estimation, grasp estimation, 
and motion planning of the robotic arm. Each of those main steps is enhanced with AI tools and 
methods such as YOLOv7 for object detection, MiDaS for depth estimation, Canny method for 
edge detection, Gen6D for pose estimation, and a neural network and numerical optimization 
technique for the motion planning of the robotic arm. The main advantage of our proposed method 
is that it only requires a monocular RGB camera. The result of our code is presented in the pdf. As per request, the code was not included.
